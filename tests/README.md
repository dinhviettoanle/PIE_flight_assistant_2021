# Tests

1. `app_django/` : First iteration of the app, but using Django framework (issue with SocketIO, I think)
2. `map_plots/` : Tests using folium package to display maps (solution not adopted due to the web app architecture, but it can be worth considering for a native app - else, Electron is also a good option for a standalone app)
3. `performance_benchmark` : Performance comparison between Pandas / DBMS (PostreSQL) / SPARQL
4. `push_to_talk_button` : Implementation of push-to-talk button and audio display
5. `speech_to_snips` : Playground for Natural Language Processing
